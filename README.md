#  House Price Prediction | Machine Learning with Python

An end-to-end **Machine Learning House Price Prediction project** built using **Python** and **Scikit-learn**. This repository demonstrates practical skills in **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, regression modeling, and model evaluation**.

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to predict house prices using structured real estate data. By applying **regression-based machine learning algorithms**, the model learns patterns from housing features and generates accurate price predictions, making it suitable for real-world analytics use cases.

##  Key Highlights
- End-to-end Machine Learning pipeline
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Regression model training and evaluation
- Performance measurement using evaluation metrics

##  Tech Stack & Tools
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Dataset Information
The dataset consists of structured housing data used for training and evaluating the machine learning model. It includes essential features influencing property prices and supports data analysis, model building, and validation.

##  Results & Outcome
This project demonstrates the practical application of **machine learning for price prediction**, highlighting skills relevant to **ML Intern, Data Analyst, and Data Science roles**.
